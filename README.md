# MFI Gamepad Feeder

Have you ever wanted to use your MFI (Made for iPhone/iPad) game controller under Windows? With *MFI Gamepad Feeder* it's possible!

## How it works?

*MFI Gamepad Feeder* is a special program that needs to be used in tandem with [vJoy](http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net "vJoy") that creates virtual joystick/gamepad device in your system.

After installing *vJoy* you will recieve dummy joystick device that won't do actually anything fancy. In order to control it, you'll have to use special kind of programs, called *feeders*, in our case *MFI Gamepad Feeder*.

It looks like modern MFI game controllers are recognized as standrad HID gamepads under Windows, but they're not visible in "USB Game Controllers", so games won't be able to use them. *MFI Gamepad Feeder* is connecing to these "HID gamepads", and it's redirecting raw input from them, directly to the vJoy devices.

On this page I will guide you how to install and configure *vJoy*, and how to pair it with *MFI Gamepad Feeder*  

## Requirements

Current version of *MFI Gamepad Feeder* requires

* installed vJoy driver (v2.1.6)
* supported MFI Gamepad (see list of supported gamepads is listed below)

Application was tested on WIndows 10, but it should work on older systems as well.

## Installation

1. Download and install [vJoy 2.1.6 ](http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net "vJoy") 
2. Download and install [MFI Gamepad Feeder](https://github.com/Axadiw/MFIGamepadFeeder/releases/latest "MFI Gamepad Feeder")
3. Launch *Configure vJoy* application and select:

4. Launch *MFI Gamepad Feeder* application, click it's icon in the taskbar in order to maximize it, and select:
	1. Your gamepad from "Gamepad device" list. In my case (Steelseries Nimbus gamepad), gamepad wasn't advertising itself with correct Product name / Manufacturer Name, so I've had to guess which one it was
	2. ID of your vJoy ("1" in most cases)
	3. Correct configuration file (All configuration files are stored in the "Configs" folder in the application folder
	4. Hit Refresh

I've successfulyl tested this app with [TocaEdit Xbox 360 Controller Emulator](http://www.x360ce.com/default.aspx "TocaEdit Xbox 360 Controller Emulator"), so you can use your MFI gamepads as Xbox 360 controller!
